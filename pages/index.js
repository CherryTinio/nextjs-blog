        <p>I am Cherry Love Tinio, 21 yrs of age currently taking IT course. I was born at Quezon city but is now living in San Joaquin sta ana pampanga.
        I fell in love with animation videos when I was still young that is one of the reasons why I took IT in college, although initially I was supposed to take nursing because of my passion and motivation to learn animation 
        I took IT instead. I love playing video games, drawing, singing, listening to music, and traveling. </p>
